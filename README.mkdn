Getting Started with making tree for dotOS from LOS
---------------------------------------------------
To get started with the building process, you'll need to get familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/DotOS/manifest.git -b dot-n

Then to sync up:

    repo sync  -f --force-sync --no-clone-bundle

Additionally, you can define the number of parallel download repo should do:

    repo sync -f -jX --force-sync --no-clone-bundle    ( X is the number of parallel download repo should do choose depending on your cpu )

To create tree:

    get a los based tree and open vendorsetup.sh, lineage.mk and AndroidProducts.mk (if there) and rename all "lineage" or "cm" with "dot"


To compile the rom :

	. build/envsetup.sh (choose your preference there )
   
    lunch dot_$codename
   
  	brunch $codename
	
	
Getting Official Maintainership for dotOS
-----------------------------------------
To get Official Maintainership for dotOS you should have a stable device sources

First make a unofficial build of dotOS and post in [**XDA**](xda-developers.com) 

Fill this form up :- [**Maintainership Form**](https://goo.gl/forms/HBamYej6Ia9sdnhF2) 
Note : You get addded or selected for a single device doesnt give you authority to skip the FORM, and get to maintain other device(s) also. You have to apply again for a new device.
MAINTAINERSHIP HAS A PROPER CHAIN TO FOLLOW.

After that We will contact you by judging your Un-Official build published on xda
